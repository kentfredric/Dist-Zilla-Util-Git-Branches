NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Branches - Extract branches from Git

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    This module aims to do what you want when you think you want to parse
    the output of

        git branch

    Except it works the right way, and uses

        git for-each-ref

    So

        use Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Branches;

        my $branches = Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Branches->new(
            zilla => $self->zilla
        );
        for my $branch ( $branches->branches ) {
            printf "%s %s", $branch->name, $branch->sha1;
        }

METHODS
  "branches"
    Returns a "::Branch" object for each local branch.

  "current_branch"
    Returns a "::Branch" object if currently on a "branch", "undef"
    otherwise.

        my $b = $branches->current_branch;
        if ( defined $b ) {
            printf "Currently on: %s", $b->name;
        } else {
            print "Detached HEAD";
        }
